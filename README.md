# Report 

The creation of this course was very complicated for me, and it took me a long time to complete, especially the part showing the history of all the purchases. 
The activity passed the data correctly through Gson, but I don't understand why it doesn't show up in the recyclerView. I think that I spent more than 6 hours trying to find the problem in one day ( I spent more time before).

One issue that I have is that the app is super slow. So testing is really complicated. I don't know if my devices are the problem or is the number of requests and the Picasso(). 
Another problem is that it did not work for me https://thispersondoesnotexist.com. It took me a long time to wait, and I got an error on many occasions. As you can see, I changed it for cats (I hope it is not a problem).

Due to lack of time and health complications, I could not make the application in a way that is more user-friendly and improve the UI. But I am happy with the result and can apply the concepts learned. 

Although the application is not perfect (far from it), I am happy with the results. 

I tried to experiment on the application a little bit, to try different ways to get the result. 

I am aware that the code could be more structured and cleaner. 

What I found extremely complicated and that I can't understand how the tokens work to login the user. 

In the map question, I didn't want to generate an API key since it costs, and I had a bad experience using it in the past.
I didn't manage to do some things, but at least I tried. In the future, I will keep trying to improve this project. 

There were many hours invested in the project, but I had fun. 

I take this opportunity to thank you for your time and effort in the class. I just want to tell you that it was very productive because I am happy with what I learned since I had no experience in mobile development and Kotlin. Thank you!
